Inherit the featured image from the Post, Page, or Custom Post Type parent, grand-parent, great-grand-parent, etc.

== Description ==

If no featured image has been selected for a post, page, or custom post type, this plugin will assign the first featured image found from its parent, grand-parent, great-grand-parent, etc.

The plugin makes no permanent changes &mdash; simply deactivate the plugin to disable the automatically inherited images. ;-)

There are no plugin settings &mdash; simply *install* and *activate* the plugin.

<h3>Coded for Performance</h3>

This plugin uses the WordPress `wp_cache_get()` and `update_meta_cache()` functions for maximum performance and fully integrate with WordPress core functionality.
